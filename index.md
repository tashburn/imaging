- Each entry below is the files on an imaging CD. Each CD's files are available in either a ZIP bundle or an ISO bundle.
- Click the ZIP or ISO link to download that file.
- Each ZIP file is a compressed bundle of all files on the CD. After downloading in Windows, right-click on the file and select "Extract All" to uncompress the zip file to access the files and viewer.
- Each ISO file is a snapshot of the entire CD that can be mounted like a CD. After downloading in Windows, double-click the ISO file to mount it. Then you should be able to access the files and viewer, as if it was a CD.
- Most of the CDs contain viewers made for Windows, some for Mac.
- If you have a problem accessing the files, please let Trenton know.
